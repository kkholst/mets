\description{
Fits additive gamma frailty model
with additive hazard condtional on the random effects
\deqn{
\lambda_{ij} = (V_{ij}^T Z) (X_{ij}^T \alpha(t))
}
The baseline \eqn{\alpha(t)} is profiled out using
marginal modelling adjusted for the random effects structure as in Eriksson and Scheike (2015).
One advantage of the standard frailty model is that one can deal with competing risks
for this model.

For all models the
standard errors do not reflect this uncertainty of the baseline estimates, and might therefore be a bit to small.
To remedy this one can do bootstrapping.

If clusters contain more than two times, we use a composite likelihood
based on the pairwise bivariate models. Can also fit a additive gamma random
effects model described in detail below.

We allow a regression structure for the indenpendent gamma distributed
random effects  and their variances that may depend on cluster covariates. So
\deqn{
 \theta = z_j^T \alpha
}
where \eqn{z} is specified by theta.des
The reported standard errors are based on the estimated information from the
likelihood assuming that the marginals are known.

Can also fit a structured additive gamma random effects model, such
as the ACE, ADE model for survival data.

Now random.design specificies the random effects for each subject within a cluster. This is
a matrix of 1's and 0's with dimension n x d.  With d random effects.
For a cluster with two subjects, we let the random.design rows be
 \eqn{v_1} and \eqn{v_2}.
Such that the random effects for subject
1 is \deqn{v_1^T (Z_1,...,Z_d)}, for d random effects. Each random effect
has an associated parameter \eqn{(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_d)}.
By construction subjects 1's random effect are Gamma distributed with
mean \eqn{\lambda_j/v_1^T \lambda}
and variance \eqn{\lambda_j/(v_1^T \lambda)^2}. Note that the random effect
\eqn{v_1^T (Z_1,...,Z_d)} has mean 1 and variance \eqn{1/(v_1^T \lambda)}.
It is here asssumed that  \eqn{lamtot=v_1^T \lambda} is fixed over all clusters
as it would be for the ACE model below.
The lamtot parameter may be specified separately for some sets of the parameter
is the additive.gamma.sum (ags) matrix is specified and then lamtot for the
j'th random effect is \eqn{ags_j^T \lambda}.

Based on these parameters the relative contribution (the heritability, h) is
equivalent to  the expected values of the random effects  \eqn{\lambda_j/v_1^T \lambda}

The DEFAULT parametrization uses the variances of the random effecs
\deqn{
\theta_j  = \lambda_j/(v_1^T \lambda)^2
}
For alternative parametrizations one can specify how the parameters relate to \eqn{\lambda_j}
with the function

Given the random effects the survival distributions with a cluster are independent and
on the form
\deqn{
P(T > t| x,z) = exp( -Z  A(t) \exp( Z^t beta))
}

The parameters \eqn{(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_d)}
are related to the parameters of the model
by a regression construction \eqn{pard} (d x k), that links the \eqn{d}
\eqn{\lambda} parameters
with the (k) underlying \eqn{\theta} parameters
\deqn{
\lambda = theta.des  \theta
}
here using theta.des to specify these low-dimension association. Default is a diagonal matrix.

The case.control option that can be used with the pair specification of the pairwise parts
of the estimating equations. Here it is assumed that the second subject of each pair is the
proband.
