\description{
Simulation of two-stage recurrent events data based on Cox/Cox or Cox/Ghosh-Lin structure. type=3 will generate
Cox/Cox twostage mode, type=2 will generate Ghosh-Lin/Cox model. 
If the variance is var.z=0, then generates data without any dependence or frailty. If model="twostage" then default is to generate data from Ghosh-Lin/Cox model, and
if type=3 then will generate data with marginal Cox models (Cox/Cox). 
Simulation based on linear aproximation of hazard for two-stage models based on grid on time-scale. Must be sufficientyly fine.
}
\details{
Must specify baselines of recurrent events and terminal event and possible covariate effects.
