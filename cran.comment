This resubmission fixes the date entry in the DESCRIPTION file.
The tests have also been altered to reduce the overall check-time which seems to be a problem on r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64. It seems this is primarily related to build times and thus the overall check-time may be hard to reduce further, unless I am mistaken?

Kind regards,
